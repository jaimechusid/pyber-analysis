# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this project, I served as a Data Analyst for PyBer and was tasked with analyzing large datasets and creating visualizations to display the differences in ride-sharing data between Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. To complete the new analysis, I was given the following tasks:
- Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type
- Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas and Matplotlib

## Results
Total Rides
Total Drivers
Total Fares
Average Fare per Ride
Average Fare per Driver

## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
