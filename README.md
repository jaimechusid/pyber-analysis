# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this project, I served as a Data Analyst for PyBer and was tasked with analyzing large datasets and creating visualizations to display the differences in ride-sharing data between Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. To complete the new analysis, I was given the following tasks:
- Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type
- Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas and Matplotlib

## Results
Total Rides
- Urban cities have significantly more rides than Rural and Suburban cities, with 1,625 out of a total of 2,375. Rural cities had 125 rides and Suburban cities had 625 rides. A breakdown of the total rides between the cities is shown in the pie chart below.
- ![% of Total Rides by City Type]('/analysis/Fig6.png')

## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
